Docker Compose Repository for WordPress with XDebug Support
---

This repository has been created to address the lack of a sensible Docker Compose project that supports WordPress along with XDebug for streamlined development. Many existing Docker Compose projects do not offer comprehensive XDebug integration, making effective work on WordPress-based projects challenging.

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a complete and well-organized development environment that enables:

1. **Swift WordPress Deployment**: The repository provides a ready-to-use `docker-compose.yml` file that automatically launches WordPress along with essential services like the database.

2. **XDebug Integration**: The XDebug configuration is fully integrated, allowing developers to efficiently debug their code in real-time.

3. **Flexibility**: Thanks to the repository's modular structure, it's easy to customize and expand the development environment according to project requirements.

4. **Scalability**: The repository offers flexible Docker container configurations, making it easy to scale resources as needed for the project.

Configuration, deployment, and debugging instructions can be found in the README file in this repository. For questions or suggestions, please reach out through the Issues section.

If you're a developer working on WordPress projects and need a consistent and efficient development environment with XDebug support, this Docker Compose repository is tailored for you. Save time on setup and focus on creating incredible WordPress-based websites!
